Pixel Dodge
Objective:

To create a functional game with as many features that we are can implement within the given time. This will demonstrate our ability to work with physical hardware as well as software.

Flow:

For the basic model of our game will be creating a pixel block that will be limited to upward and downward motion focused on the left side of the screen. Where random blocks will be spawning on the right side. Where the user will have use the joystick to navigate the blocks.
	
To do this we will be implementing a system that will be spawning blocks at a certain rate. This will be done in a way that every time the machine makes a cycle the player can move on block but a projectile (the block that the user will have to avoid) will be spawning every x amount of refreshes.
